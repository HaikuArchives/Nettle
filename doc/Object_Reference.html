<P>This is a class by class breakdown of the Nettle library.  Each class
is described with a class description, a description of any data types
defined, a description of public data members, a description of public
member functions, and some short usage examples.  The examples are stripped
to the minimum to illustrate the classes in question, and are lacking in
error handling, etc.  See the example code provided in ./examples for
more complete example code.</P>

<A NAME="cxxnettle"> Nettle C++ interface</A>
</H1>
<P> 
This section describes the Nettle C++ interface.  
Nettle is designed to work in an environment
where the consumer of the API is comfortable using blocking I/O
with exception-based error handling.

<A NAME="NLAddress">class NLAddress</A>
</H2>

<P>NLAddress is a class that encapsulates network address representation.
It provides various ways to get and set a network address, converting
to or from the chosen representation into a generic internal one.</P>

<P>NLAddress is also a repository for useful network addressing constants.</P>

<B>Public Defined Types:</B>

<B>Public Member Functions:</B>
<PRE>
	NLAddress::NLAddress(const char *hostname = 0, unsigned short port = 0);
	NLAddress::NLAddress(struct sockaddr_in &sa);
	NLAddress::NLAddress(in_addr addr, int port = 0);

The various constructors.  All convert the passed-in data to an internal
internet address representation.  The first throws an NLException if
host name lookup fails for the specified host.  The char * may 
be in either dotted-decimal or host name format.  If the hostname is 
left NULL in the first one, NLAddress::addr_any is assumed.
	
	void NLAddress::set(const char *hostname = 0, unsigned short port = 0);
	void NLAddress::set(struct sockaddr_in &sa);
	void NLAddress::set(in_addr addr, int port = 0);
	void NLAddress::set(NLAddress::e_addr addr=NLAddress::addr_any, int port = 0);

NLAddress::set() sets the internal address representation to refer to the
internet address specified by the passed-in data.  The first throws an 
NLException if host name lookup fails for the passed-in host.  The char * 
 may be in either dotted-decimal or host name format.  If the 
hostname is left NULL in the first one, NLAddress::addr_any is assumed.
		
	void NLAddress::get(char *hostname = 0, unsigned short *port = 0) const;
	void NLAddress::get(struct sockaddr_in &sa) const;
	void NLAddress::get(in_addr &addr, unsigned short *port = 0) const;

NLAddress::get() converts the internal internet address representation into 
the specified form and returns it by filling in the passed-in parameters.
In the first (char *) version of this call, it is assumed that the user has
passed in a char array large enough to hold the address.  A good size to use 
for such an array would be NLAddress::maxhostnamelen + 1.
</PRE>
<P><B>Usage examples:</B></P>

<P>The first example sets the NLAddress to point to the FTP port on Be's
ftp server, ftp.be.com:</P>
<code><b><pre>
void ftp_be()
{
	NLAddress addr("ftp.be.com" , NLAddress::tcpFtp);
	[...]
}
</pre></b></code>

<P>The next example uses an NLEndpoint (described below) to bounce a 
UDP packet off of Sun Microsystems' web site:</P>
<code><b><pre>
void ping_sun()
{
	NLAddress addr;
	char *s = "Hello!!!";
	NLEndpoint comm(NLEndpoint::datagram);
	
	addr.set("www.sun.com", NLAddress::udpEcho);
	comm.sendto((void *) s, strlen(s), addr);
}
</pre></b></code>

<P>The last example gets the address of a NLEndpoint which has been
bound to a random port on the machine and prints out the info:</P>


<pre>
void bind_and_print()
{
	NLEndpoint comm(NLEndpoint::datagram);
	NLAddress addr;
	char addrstr[NLAddress::maxhostnamelen];
	unsigned short port;
	
	comm.bind();
	addr = comm.getAddr();
	addr.get(addrstr, &port)
}
</pre>

<H2>
<A NAME="NLEndpoint">class NLEndpoint</A>
</H2>

<P>NLEndpoint is an object that implements a networking endpoint abstraction.
You can think of it as an object-oriented socket.  NLEndpoint provides 
various ways to send and receive data, establish network connections,
bind to local addresses, and listen for and accept new connections.
NLEndpoint member functions map fairly orthogonally to many standard
BSD sockets calls.</P>

<P>NLEndpoint also defines some useful types and constants.</P>

<B>Public Defined Types:</B>
<PRE>
<code><b>
	 enum {[...]} NLEndpoint::e_type;
</b></code>
NLEndpoint::e_type is an enumeration specifying a type of networking
protocol, for example NLEndpoint::stream for a connected, "reliable" 
stream protocol (TCP) and NLEndpoint::datagram for a connectionless,
"nonreliable" datagram protocol (UDP).
<code><b>
	 enum {[...]} NLEndpoint::e_options;
</b></code>	
NLEndpoint::e_options is an enumeration of valid socket options for use
in our data communications, for example NLEndpoint::nonblockopt for
non-blocking I/O.
<code><b>
	 enum {[...]} NLEndpoint::e_optlevel;
</b></code>	
NLEndpoint::e_optlevel is an enumeration of valid option levels, such as
NLEndpoint::sol_socket.
<code><b>
	 enum {[...]} NLEndpoint::e_flags;
</b></code>	
NLEndpoint::e_flags is an enumeration of valid flags for use sending and
receiving data, such as NLEndpoint::msg_oob for out-of-band data.
<code><b>
	 enum {[...]} NLEndpoint::e_proto;
</b></code>
NLEndpoint::e_proto is another enumeration of protocols, such as
NLEndpoint::proto_icmp.
</PRE>
<B>Public Member Functions:</B>

<P><B>Important note: all calls in this object with a void return type
will either succeed or throw an NLException on failure.</B></P>
<PRE>
<code><b>
	NLEndpoint::NLEndpoint(NLEndpoint::e_type proto = NLEndpoint::stream);
	virtual NLEndpoint::~NLEndpoint();
</b></code>
The constructor and destructor.  The constructor takes an optional argument
indicating whether to use a a connected, "reliable" stream protocol (TCP) 
or a connectionless, "nonreliable" datagram protocol (UDP).  The default 
is to use TCP.
<code><b>	
	void NLEndpoint::setProtocol(NLEndpoint::e_type);
</b></code>
NLEndpoint::setProtocol() allows the protocol type to be changed from stream
to datagram and vice-versa.  The current connection (if any) is closed and 
the NLEndpoint's state is reset.
<code><b>	
	int NLEndpoint::setOption(NLEndpoint::e_options opt, NLEndpoint::e_optlevel lev, const void *data, unsigned int datasize);
	int NLEndpoint::setNonBlock(bool on = true);
	int NLEndpoint::setReuseAddr(bool on = true);
</b></code>
These functions allow various options to be set on our data communications.
The first allows any option to be set;  the latter two turn nonblocking
I/O on or off, and toggle reuseaddr respectively.  The default is for 
*blocking* I/O and reuseaddr to be OFF.
<code><b>
	inline const NLAddress &NLEndpoint::getAddr();
</b></code>
Returns a NLAddress corresponding to the internet address used by this 
NLEndpoint.
<code><b>
	inline const NLAddress &NLEndpoint::getPeer();
</b></code>
Returns a NLAddress corresponding to the internet address of the remote
peer we are connected to, if connected.  If not connected (i.e. currently 
unconnected and using NLEndpoint::stream, or if using NLEndpoint::datagram
at all), throws an NLException.
<code><b>
	inline int NLEndpoint::getSocket();
</b></code>
Returns the actual socket file descriptor used by this NLEndpoint.  This
value is not necessarily constant over the life of an NLEndpoint.
<code><b>	
	virtual void NLEndpoint::close();
</b></code>
Close the current NLEndpoint, terminating any existing connection (if any)
and discarding unread data.
<code><b>	
	virtual void NLEndpoint::bind(const NLAddress &addr);
	virtual void NLEndpoint::bind(int port = 0);
</b></code>
Bind this NLEndpoint to a local address.  Calling bind() without specifying
a NLAddress ot port number binds to a random local port.  The actual port
bound to can be determined by a subsequent call to NLEndpoint::getAddr().
<code><b>	
	virtual void  NLEndpoint::connect(const NLAddress &addr);
	virtual void  NLEndpoint::connect(const char *hostname, int port);

</b></code>
Connect this NLEndpoint to a remote address.  The first version takes
an NLAddress already set to the remote address as an argument;  the other
one internally constructs an NLAddress from the passed-in hostname and port
number, and connect.

For NLEndpoints using protocol type NLEndpoint::stream, an actual connection 
is made.  Using NLEndpoint::datagram, the call caches the remote address so
that the send() and recv() member functions (see below) may be used rather
than sendto() and recvfrom(), as usually required of datagram NLEndpoints.
<code><b>
	virtual NLEndpoint *NLEndpoint::accept(long timeout = -1);
</b></code>
Accepts new connections to a bound NLEndpoint::stream protocol NLEndpoint.
Blocks for timeout milleseconds (defaults to forever) waiting for 
new connections.  Returns an NLEndpoint with the same characteristics
as the one calling NLEndpoint::accept(), the new one representing the new 
connection.  This returned NLEndpoint is ready for communication and 
must be deleted at a later time using delete.

Throws an NLException if interrupted or on failure for any reason.
Returns 0 if it timed out before a new connection request is received.
<code><b>
	virtual void NLEndpoint::listen(int backlog = 5);
</b></code>	
Specify the number of pending incoming connection attemps to queue.
This is the number of connection requests that will be allowed in between
calls to NLEndpoint::accept().  When this number is exceeded, new 
connection attempts are refused until NLEndpoint::accept() is called.
<code><b>
	inline void NLEndpoint::throwOnSendError(bool t = true);
	inline void NLEndpoint::throwOnRecvError(bool t = true);
	inline int NLEndpoint::getLastError();
	inline char *NLEndpoint::getLastErrorStr();
</b></code>
Error dispatch control functions for the send and recv calls (see below).
These functions allow you to select how errors that occur in send and recv
(and sendto and recvfrom) are handled.  By default, NLExceptions are thrown 
when these functions fail.  However, this is not the nicest behavior when
using non-blocking sockets, because the calls will often fail and set errno 
to EWOULDBLOCK because the call would block.  To avoid this problem, the 
functions NLEndpoint::throwOnSendError() and NLEndpoint::throwOnRecvError()
allow you to cause the send and recv functions to return -1 rather than
throwing an exception on failure.  NLEndpoint::throwOnSendError(false)
causes exceptions NOT to be thrown on send and sendto failure.  Likewise 
for NLEndpoint::throwOnRecvError(false).  Passing true in either function
restores the default behavior.

When throwing is disabled for those calls, the send/recv family return -1 
on failure.  When that happens, NLEndpoint::getLastError() will return the 
integer error code (set by the OS) for the last send/recv error.  Likewise,
NLEndpoint::getLastErrorStr() returns a string describing the error.
<code><b>
	virtual size_t NLEndpoint::send(const void *buf, size_t size, int flags = 0);
	virtual size_t NLEndpoint::send(NLPacket &pack, int flags = 0);
</b></code>
Sends data to the remote end of the connection.  If not connected, fails. 
If using NLEndpoint::datagram protocol, fails unless NLEndpoint::connect()
has been called, which caches the address we are sending to.  The first 
version sends an arbitrary buffer of size size; the second sends the 
contents of a NLPacket(see below). Both return the number of bytes actually 
sent, and throw a NLException on failure.
<code><b>
	virtual size_t NLEndpoint::sendto(const void *buf, size_t size, const NLAddress &to, int flags = 0);
	virtual size_t NLEndpoint::sendto(NLPacket &pack, const NLAddress &to, int flags = 0);
</b></code>
Sends data to the address specified by the passed-in NLAddress object.
Fails if not using NLEndpoint::datagram protocol.  The first version sends
an arbitrary buffer of size size; the second sends the contents of a 
NLPacket(see below).  Both return the number of bytes actually sent, 
and (by default) throw a NLException on failure.
<code><b>	
	inline void NLEndpoint::setRecvTimeout(long l);
</b></code>
Sets an optional timeout (in milleseconds) for calls to NLEndpoint::recv()
and NLEndpoint::recvfrom().  Causes these calls to time out after the specified
number of milleseconds when in blocking mode (the default).
<code><b>
	virtual size_t NLEndpoint::recv(void *buf, size_t size, int flags = 0);
	virtual size_t NLEndpoint::recv(NLPacket &pack, size_t size, int flags = 0);
</b></code>
Receives data pending on the NLEndpoint's connection.  If in the default 
blocking mode, blocks until data is available.  If in nonblocking mode, 
returns immediately.  The first call receives into a preallocated buffer 
of the specified size; the second call receives (at most) size bytes into 
an NLPacket. The data is appended to the end of the NLPacket;  this allows
an NLPacket to be used in a loop to buffer incoming data read in chunks 
until a certain size is read.

Both return the number of bytes actually received, and (by default) throw 
a NLException on failure. A valid receive of size zero indicates that the 
other end has closed the connection, and this NLEndpoint should be closed 
via NLEndpoint::close(), or deleted.

NLEndpoints using the NLEndpoint::datagram protocol may use these calls 
if NLEndpoint::connect() has been called, otherwise they must use the
NLEndpoint::recvfrom calls.
<code><b>
	virtual size_t NLEndpoint::recvfrom(void *buf, size_t size, NLAddress &from, int flags = 0);
	virtual size_t NLEndpoint::recvfrom(NLPacket &pack, size_t size, NLAddress &from, int flags = 0);
</b></code>
These are the datagram analogues of recv, above.  They receive datagrams from an
arbitrary source and fill in the passed-in NLAddress with the address from
whence the datagram came.  As usual, both return the actual number of bytes 
read.  In the NLPacket version, The data is appended to the end of the 
NLPacket;  this allows an NLPacket to be used in a loop to buffer incoming 
data read in chunks until a certain amount is read.

<code><b>	
	virtual bool NLEndpoint::isDataPending(long timeout = 0);
</b></code>
Returns true if there is data waiting to be received on this NLEndpoint.
Will block for timeout milleseconds if specified, waiting for data.
<code><b>
	virtual NLEndpoint *NLEndpoint::clone(NLEndpoint *);
</b></code>
Produces a copy of this NLEndpoint and returns it.
</PRE>
<P><B>Usage examples:</B></P>
<P>The following program implements a simple UDP echo daemon.  This code 
binds a datagram NLEndpoint to the UDP Echo well-known port (referenced 
by NLAddress::udpEcho), then repeatedly loops, blocking until a datagram
arrives, when it sends the datagram back to the sender, prints a log 
message, and waits for the next datagram.</P>

<code><b><pre>
int main(int, char**)
{
	char buf[8192], addrstr[128];
	NLEndpoint comm(NLEndpoint::datagram);
	NLAddress addr;	
	int rc;

	comm.bind(NLAddress::udpEcho);
	
	while(1)
	{
		rc = comm.recvfrom(buf, sizeof(buf), addr);
		comm.sendto(buf, rc, addr);
		addr.get(addrstr);
	}

	return -1;	
}
</pre></b></code>
<P>
The next example is a simple client to test the above daemon with.
It takes the a command-line argument as the host name to send 
datagrams to, sends a datagram, then receives the return datagram.
</P>
<code><b><pre>
int main(int argc, char**argv)
{
	NLEndpoint comm(NLEndpoint::datagram);
	NLAddress addr;
	char *sendstr = "Hello!!!";
	char buf[1024];
	int rc;
	
	addr.set(argv[1], NLAddress::udpEcho);
	
	rc = comm.sendto(sendstr, strlen(sendstr) + 1, addr);
	comm.recvfrom(buf, rc, addr);	
	return 0;
}
</pre></b></code>
<P>The next example is a "grumpy" server, which accepts TCP connections
and tells the connectee to go away:
</P>
<code><b><pre>
int main(int, char**)
{
	char addrstr[128], *goaway = "Go away!";
	NLEndpoint comm, *rep;
	NLAddress addr;	
	unsigned short port;
	
	comm.bind();
	comm.listen();		
	addr = comm.getAddr();
	addr.get(addrstr, &port);

	while(1)
	{
		rep = comm.accept();
		rep->send(goaway, strlen(goaway));
		delete rep;
	}
	
	return -1;	
}

</pre></b></code>
<H2>
<A NAME="NLPacket">class NLPacket</A>
</H2>

<P>
NLPacket is a dynamic buffer useful for storing data to be sent across
the network.  Data is inserted into and removed from the object using
one of the many insert and remove member functions.  Access to the raw
stored data is possible.  The NLEndpoint class has a send and recv 
function for use with NLPacket.  Network byte order conversion is done
automatically for all appropriate types in the insert and remove functions
for that type.
</P>
<B>Public Member Functions:</B>
<PRE>
<code><b>

	NLPacket::NLPacket(size_t size = 0);
	NLPacket::~NLPacket();
</b></code>
The Constructor and destructor.  The ctor takes an optional size argument
which specifies a size to initially allocate for the internal buffer.  This
is useful for effeciency when the total data size is known or can be 
estimated before inserting individual data.
<code><b>
	void NLPacket::insert(char);
	void NLPacket::insert(unsigned char);
	void NLPacket::insert(short);
	void NLPacket::insert(unsigned short);
	void NLPacket::insert(int);
	void NLPacket::insert(unsigned int);
	void NLPacket::insert(long);
	void NLPacket::insert(unsigned long);
	void NLPacket::insert(float);
	void NLPacket::insert(double);
	void NLPacket::insert(const char *);
	void NLPacket::insert(const void *, size_t);
</b></code>
Data insertion member functions.  Data is inserted at the end of the internal 
dynamic buffer.  For the short, int, and long versions (and unsigned of 
each as well) byte order conversion is performed.  Ints are promoted to 
longs internally.  The terminating null of all strings are inserted as 
well.  The last version of this function inserts a generic data buffer of 
specified size. 

All versions of NLPacket::insert() throw an NLException if allocation of
the internal buffer fails in new().
<code><b>
	void NLPacket::remove(char &);
	void NLPacket::remove(unsigned char &);
	void NLPacket::remove(short &);
	void NLPacket::remove(unsigned short &);
	void NLPacket::remove(int &);
	void NLPacket::remove(unsigned int &);
	void NLPacket::remove(long &);
	void NLPacket::remove(unsigned long &);
	void NLPacket::remove(float &);
	void NLPacket::remove(double &);
</b></code>
Data extraction member functions.  Data is extracted from the start of the 
internal dynamic buffer.  For the short, int, and long versions (and 
unsigned of each as well) byte order conversion is performed.  
<code><b>	
	void NLPacket::remove(char *, size_t);
	void NLPacket::remove(void *, size_t);
</b></code>	
Extraction of strings and generic data.  It is assumed that preallocated memory of
the specified size is passed to 
these functions.  For the 
char * version, data is extracted until a terminating NULL *or* the specified
size has been extracted.  For the void * version, data of the specified size 
is extracted.

All versions of NLPacket::remove() throw an NLException if extraction is 
attempted past the logical end of the NLPacket.

<code><b>
	inline unsigned char *NLPacket::getData();
</b></code>	
getData() returns a pointer to the internal data buffer.  This is useful
when wanting to pass the data to a function expecting a pointer to data.
<code><b>	
	inline size_t NLPacket::getSize();
</b></code>
getSize() returns the size of the NLPacket's data, in bytes.
<code><b>
	inline size_t NLPacket::getBytesRemaining();
</b></code>
getBytesRemaining() returns the bytes remaining in the NLPacket available
to be extracted via NLPacket::remove().
</PRE>
<P><B>Usage examples:</B></P>
<P>In this example, a hypothetical client sends some data to a server.  Both
sides use an NLPacket for holding the data.  In the example, it is assumed 
that the client/server protocol is for a length field of 4 bytes, a 2 byte
request id, and then the request data to be sent.

<A NAME="NLException">class NLException</A>
</H2>

<P>
NLException is the exception class thrown by all classes in this library.
As it is simple, it is shown here in its entirety.
</P>
<pre>
<code><b>
class NLException
{
public:

m_file is the name of the file where the was thrown.  m_line is the 
line number.  m_where contains the name of the object and member function
throwing the exception.  m_what is the reason the exception was thrown. 
m_arg is an optional argument, usually set to the object that threw the 
exception.

	NLException::print(char *s);

This function inserts a human-readable version of the exception into 
the passed-in string.  

There are several macros to assist in easily throwing this exception 
yourself.  See the header file for details.
