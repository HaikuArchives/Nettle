<B><H3><A NAME="abstract">1. Abstract</A></H3></B>


<P>Nettle is an object oriented abstraction over network socket communications.  
It is a portable library based on the BSD sockets interface.  Nettle is primarily
being developed under BeOS (PR) and Solaris (2.5.1), but it should be portable to 
other operating systems as well as long as a reasonably complete BSD sockets interface 
exists.  Since this includes all popular OS's I'm aware of (except the MacOS) this 
library should work just about anywhere.</P>

<P>See the <A HREF="./Object_Reference.html">Object_Reference</A> 
for information on using the library.  To build the library, either run the makescript 
in the top level directory, or (for now) run "config" yourself and type make in the top level directory.
Solaris users, note that the config script will try to detect SPARCWorks CC and configure for it
if found; otherwise it will configure for g++.  If you are a SPARCWorks user but wish to build using 
the gnu compiler, you will have to link make.incl to solaris-gcc.incl by hand.</P>

documented and maintained separately from the unmodified source distribution.</P>

<B><H3><A NAME="features">3. Upcoming Features</A></H3></B>

<P><LI>Will distribute with imake or gnu autoconf to replace the cheezy 
config system I use now.</LI></P>

<P><LI>Java Nettle examples, a debug class, and NLSelector to multiplex NLEndpoints.</LI></P>

<P><LI>A simple transaction protocol will be introduced; NLTransaction will contain a
NLPacket and a NLPacketHeader object, and NLTransactionEnpoint will contain send 
and recv of atomic transaction packets, providing packet boundary services.</LI> </P>

<P><LI>I'm also planning on adding portable networking classes for use in multithreaded
programs;  a NLActiveObject and NLReactor are forthcoming, based on (strangely 
enough :-) the Active Object and Reactor design patterns.</LI></P>



<B><H3><A NAME="comments">4. Comments</A></H3></B>

<P>Everyone I know doing network programming has wanted a simple OO interface to 
networking primitives.  There are some packages out there, and surprisingly the
free ones like Gnanasekaran Swaminathan's socket++ and Douglas Schmidt's ACE are
generally better than the commercial solutions (IMHO, at least).  Unfortunately,
I still seem to spend significant time working around libraries such as those.
Often they provide an interface that is (IMO) very high level and has a steeper
learning curve (like ACE), is too dependant on specific language features (like
socket++ and its reliance on the internal workings of the iostreams library), is 
platform-specific, or in general tends to get away from the functionality I wanted 
in the first place, which is a simple OO abstraction over networking.</P>

<P>Hence, the core of Nettle will always be the simple NLEndpoint, NLAddress, NLPacket 
and NLException classes.  More advanced features will be added, but those classes
are all one will ever REALLY NEED to use in the library (even NLPacket is optional).</P>

<P>One comment about multithreading issues.  After carefully considering things, I 
decided to leave the core objects unsynchronized and require the users of these objects 
to synchronize access to them.  I did this mainly because there are several different
ways to synchronize access to some of them depending on what you want to do with them.
I decided that the consumer of this API would know better how they wanted to synchonize
the networking primitives than a general case could provide, particularly with respect
to performance issues.</P>

<B><H3><A NAME="release">6. Release Notes</A></H3></B>

<P><B>version 1.6 (Nov 1998)</B>
Minor release.  Fixed a bug in NLEndpoint::IsDataPending() reported 
by Chris Tate.</P>
<P><B>version 1.5 (Sep 1998)</B>
Minor release.  Contains bug fixes, and removes the requirement of a C++ std library due to popular
demand.  Now links under BeOS using the 64k linker.  Minor API changes.
</P>
<P><B>version 1.2 (Dec 1997)</B>
Minor release.  Contains minor bug fixes and cleanup, and adds support for 
Linux under g++ 2.7.x and for the Sun SPARCWorks compiler using the ObjectSpace 
C++ standard library.</P>

<P><B>version 1.0 (Nov 1997)</B>
Major release.
Many bug fixes from the beta.  Ported to Solaris.  New directory layout and makefiles.</P>

<P><B>version 0.9b1 (Aug 1997)</B>
Major release.
First release, public beta.  NLEndpoint, NLAddress, NLPacket, NLException classes.
Unoptimized.  Few examples.  BeOS support only.</P>
