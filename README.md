Nettle
======

Nettle is an object oriented abstraction over network socket communications. It
is a portable library based on the BSD sockets interface. Nettle is primarily
being developed under BeOS (PR) and Solaris (2.5.1), but it should be portable
to other operating systems as well as long as a reasonably complete BSD sockets
interface exists.
